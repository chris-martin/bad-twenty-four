Mark Dominus poses this question:

> Suppose *S* is a multiset whose elements are among the numbers *1, 2, ... 9*.  Say that *S* is "good" if there is some arithmetic expression involving only +, -, ×, and ÷, that uses all of the elements of *S* and has a value of 24.  For example, *S = {1, 1, 2, 8}* is good because *1×8×(1+2) = 24*, but *S = {1,1,2,5}* is not good. (Proof omitted.) It's easy to show that every sufficiently large *S* is good. What's the maximal example of a bad *S*?
